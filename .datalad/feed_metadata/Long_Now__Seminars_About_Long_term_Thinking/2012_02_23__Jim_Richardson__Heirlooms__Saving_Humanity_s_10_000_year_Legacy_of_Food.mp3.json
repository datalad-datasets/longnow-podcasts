"description":
"Agricultural biodiversity is as much in need of defending as the world's wildlife.  Countless varieties of plants and animals were bred by the world's peoples for talents specific to every soil, climate, and human culture.  Most of them have been lost---their hard-won genetic sophistication extinguished.  But many have survived, thanks to professional and amateur devotion, and they are wondrous---living embodiments of humanity's deepest traditions.\n\nPhotojournalist Jim Richardson has been covering the agricultural beat for National Geographic since 1984.  His spectacular photographs, and the stories he tells with them, are renowned.",
