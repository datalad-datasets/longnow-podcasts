"description":
"Arthur Ganson uses humble materials to create kinetic sculptures of humor, drama, and emotion.&nbsp; His work has been shown around the world, and has been an ongoing inspiration for the 10,000 Year Clock project at Long Now.&nbsp; His machinated gestures play with time spans that range from the epochal to the momentary.\nOne of the touchstone pieces for the Clock project is the Machine with Concrete.&nbsp; The input of the piece is a 200 revolution per minute motor, and after series of gear reductions it's output gear is cast in concrete.&nbsp; Due to the multiplicative nature of the gear train it will take upwards of two trillion years to break the final gear.&nbsp; Ganson will be discussing the theme of time in his work, and will be bringing a piece to show live at the event.",
