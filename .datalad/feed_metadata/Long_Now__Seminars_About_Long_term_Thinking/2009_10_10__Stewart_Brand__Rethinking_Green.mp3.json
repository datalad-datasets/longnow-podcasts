"This talk launches Brand's new book: Whole Earth Discipline: An Ecopragmatist Manifesto.&nbsp; His argument is that taking account of the emerging global forces of climate change, urbanization, and biotechnology forces a rethink of some traditional environmental positions.&nbsp;   Cities are Green, with huge room for improvement.&nbsp; Nuclear power is Green, with better still to come.&nbsp; Genetic engineering is Green and shows potentially revolutionary promise.&nbsp; Direct intervention in the climate---geoengineering---may be necessary.&nbsp; The classic environmental project of restoring natural systems has to step up in scale and deepen the quality of its science and engineering.",
