"description":
"Burtynsky's massively informative photographs change minds and influence policy.  They are also exquisite art.  Their historical value will grow with time.  Other art has similar reach.  There should be a gallery that collects, displays, and sifts such works over centuries and millennia, and develops ways to preserve them.  That is exactly Burtynsky's plan--- a 10,000-year Gallery to accompany the 10,000-year Clock.  His presentation will explore and demonstrate the idea.\nEdward Burtynsky is an Officer of the Order of Canada and winner of the 2004 Ted Prize.  His photographs are in the permanent collections of fifteen major museums, including the Guggenheim and Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Bibiotheque Nationale in Paris, and the Victoria &amp; Albert in London.  He is the subject of a prize-winning film, \"Manufactured Landscapes.\"",
