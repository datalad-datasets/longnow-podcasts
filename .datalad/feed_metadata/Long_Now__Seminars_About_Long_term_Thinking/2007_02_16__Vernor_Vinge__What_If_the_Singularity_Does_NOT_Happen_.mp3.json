"Technology acceleration is like what happens approaching the singularity in the center of a black hole--- everything is transformed utterly and unpredictably.  That metaphor was invented by science fiction writer Vernor Vinge in 1980s and has entered standard usage as a way of thinking about the near future.  In this talk Vinge challenges his own idea, investigating scenarios of \"a human-scaled world with long time horizons,\" and how that might play out over ten or twenty thousand years.",
