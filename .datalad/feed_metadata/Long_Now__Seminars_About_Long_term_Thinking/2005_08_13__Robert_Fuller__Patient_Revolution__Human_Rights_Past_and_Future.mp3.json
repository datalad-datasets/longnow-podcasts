"From time to time a portion of humanity declares a new human right. Behavior thought normal for thousands of years is suddenly challenged.&nbsp; What does it take for the new right to prevail?&nbsp; It takes steady bearing down on the issue over decades and centuries...\nBob Fuller is the author of Somebodies and Nobodies: Overcoming the Abuse of Rank.&nbsp; The book defines \"rankism\"--- the pervasive misuse of power relationships that is expressed not just in racism and sexism but in every form of humiliation.&nbsp; Humans have the universal right, the new movement insists, to be treated with dignity.&nbsp; Fuller was president of Oberlin College when it integrated racially in the early 1970s.&nbsp; Before that he was a highly regarded physicist working with John Wheeler.&nbsp; After that he was a \"citizen diplomat\" quietly helping end the Cold War.&nbsp; On stage he is a vivid story teller.",
