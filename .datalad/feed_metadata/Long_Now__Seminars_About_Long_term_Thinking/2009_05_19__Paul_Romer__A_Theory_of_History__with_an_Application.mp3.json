"Paul Romer is best known as the lead developer of New Growth Theory, which shows how societies can speed up the discovery and implementation of new technologies; essentially, ideas about how objects interact. However, to address the big problems we&rsquo;ll face this century; insecurity, harm to the environment, and global poverty, new technologies will not be enough.   His current focus is on mechanisms that can speed up the discovery and implementation of new rules - ideas about how people interact. For his work on the economics of ideas, Paul was named one of America&rsquo;s 25 most influential people by TIME magazine.",
