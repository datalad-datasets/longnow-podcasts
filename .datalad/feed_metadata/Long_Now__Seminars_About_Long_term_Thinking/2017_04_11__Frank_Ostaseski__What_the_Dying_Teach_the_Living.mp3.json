"It’s a lot more than “Seize the day.”  We learn from the dying to push away nothing; to lose the habit of postponing things; to show up entirely; to find rest amid whatever; to go ahead and be surprised.  You can look death right in the eye, tough as it is, and life lights up.\n\nFrank Ostaseki, one of the world’s great end-of-life counselors, has attended over a thousand dyings.  He was a cofounder of the renowned Zen Hospice in San Francisco and is the author of a new book, The Five Invitations: Discovering What Death Can Teach Us About Living Fully.",
