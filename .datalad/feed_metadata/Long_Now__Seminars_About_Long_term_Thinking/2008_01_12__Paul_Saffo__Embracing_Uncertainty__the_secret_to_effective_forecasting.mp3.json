"\"Some would argue that forecasting is a dangerous exercise in futility, but they are mistaken.  In fact, effective forecasting is not merely possible, but remarkably easy; all it takes is  simple shift in perspective and a few common-sense heuristics.\"  The most quoted futurist alive, Paul Saffo specializes in the history and future of technology.  In a recent article in the Harvard Business Review he spelled out the secrets of his trade, which he will expand on in this talk.  Saffo is a member of the board of The Long Now Foundation.",
