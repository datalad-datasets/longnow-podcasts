"Philip Rosedale is the founder of a burgeoning Web phenomenon, the massive multi-player substitute reality called \"Second Life.\"   When the scheduled speaker for this month, Francis Fukuyama, was suddenly sidelined by a motorcycle injury, Rosedale sprinted from the bench to take his place at the podium.
