"description":
"As organisms, cities, and companies scale up, they all gain in efficiency, but then they vary.  The bigger an organism, the slower.  Yet the bigger a city is, the faster it runs.  And cities are structurally immortal, while corporations are structurally doomed.  Scaling up always creates new problems; cities can innovate faster than the problems indefinitely, while corporations cannot.\n\nThese revolutionary findings come from Geoffrey West's examination of vast quantities of data on the metabolic/economic behavior of organisms and organizations.  A theoretical physicist, West was president of Santa Fe Institute from 2005 to 2009 and founded the high energy physics group at Los Alamos National Laboratory.",
