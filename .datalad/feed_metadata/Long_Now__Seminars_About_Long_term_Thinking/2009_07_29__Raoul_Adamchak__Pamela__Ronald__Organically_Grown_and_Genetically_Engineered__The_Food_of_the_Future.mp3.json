"She's the head of a plant genetics lab at UC Davis; he teaches organic farming there.  They're married (with kids), and they coauthored Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics, and the Future of Food.\nIn the book they wrote: \"To meet the appetites of the world's population without drastically hurting the environment requires a visionary new approach: combining genetic engineering and organic farming. Genetic engineering can be used to develop seeds with enhanced resistance to pests and pathogens; organic farming can manage the overall spectrum of pests more effectively.\"Agriculture has been a revolutionary biological science for 10,000 years, husbanding soil, tweaking the genes of the food crops.  This is the next stage.",
