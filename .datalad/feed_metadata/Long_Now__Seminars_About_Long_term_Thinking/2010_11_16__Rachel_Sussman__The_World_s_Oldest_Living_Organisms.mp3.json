"While we may aspire to live a century, Rachel Sussman documents creatures who don&rsquo;t bat an eye at a millennium or two.  Her photography has captured 4,500 year old bristlecone pines, 12,000 year old yucca, 400,000 year old Siberian bacteria, and many other wizened elders, all with stories longer than all of recorded human history.",
