"description":
"Brian Eno delivered the first SALT talk exactly ten years ago.  He gave The Long Now Foundation its name, contributed in no end of artistic and financial ways, and designed the chimes for the 10,000-year Clock.  Danny Hillis instigated and co-founded Long Now and designed its series of Clocks, culminating currently in the 500-foot one being built inside a west Texas mountain.  In the course of their collaboration, Eno and Hillis became fast friends.\n\nThousands of years pass a decade at a time.  The idea and works of Long Now have been active for two decades (1/500th of 10,000 years).  Between the conception and initial delivery of a deep idea, much transpires.  If the idea resonates with people, it gains a life of its own.  Allies assemble, and shape things.  Public engagement shapes things.  Funding or its absence shapes things.  Refinements of the idea emerge, branch off, and thrive or don’t.  Initial questions metastasize into potent new questions.\n\nOver time, the promotion of “long-term thinking” begins to acquire a bit of its own long term to conjure with.  Eno and Hillis have spent 20 years thinking about long-term thinking and building art for it, with ever increasing fascination.  What gets them about it?",
