"The legacy of Ursula K Le Guin lives beyond the page  in generations of writers who have learned from her. She used fantastic fiction to imagine ideals for the real world. Kim Stanley Robinson, her student 40 years ago and now a celebrated science fiction writer himself, reflects on Le Guin the teacher,  her impact on his work, and how she changed the world.\nKim Stanley Robinson is an American novelist, widely recognized as one of the foremost living writers of science fiction. His work has been described as \"humanist science fiction\" and \"literary science fiction.\" He has published more than 20 novels including his much honored \"Mars trilogy\",  New York 2140  (02017), and Red Moon due out in October 02018. Robinson has a B.A. in Literature from UC San Diego and an M.A. in English from Boston University. He earned a Ph.D. in literature from UCSD with a dissertation on the works of Philip K. Dick.\nUrsula K Le Guin was one of the greatest imaginative writers of all time.
