"So far we are trying to deal with climate change at the wrong time scale.  A really deep problem cannot be solved by shallow innovations, no matter how clever.  The scale of climate change requires thinking and acting in multi-decade terms at the level of infrastructure—personal as well as societal.  Get it right, and “the result can be like living in a beautifully managed garden.”\n\nSaul Griffith is an inventor and meta-inventor, currently founder of Otherlabs in San Francisco (devising such things as soft robotics, soft exoskeletons, cheap solar tracking, and conformable gas tanks.)  He is a MacArthur Fellow and frequent TED dazzler.  His 02009 SALT talk on Climate Change Recalculated is the most viewed video in our twelve-year series.\n\nSee our blog for updates on tickets and other media; tickets will go on sale one month before the Seminar.",
